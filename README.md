# Vixies

**AI Engineer & PhD Student** | Computer Vision Research | Hanoi, Vietnam

> "Building AI that works in production, not just on paper."

## What I Do
- PhD research in efficient computer vision for edge devices
- Side projects when academic research moves too slowly
- Debug why 99.9% accurate models fail on first user upload

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, Go, C++, Java  
**ML/AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV  
**Other:** AWS, Node.js, Flask

## Current Projects
- **PhD Thesis:** Efficient neural architectures for edge AI
- **Side Projects:** Building practical AI applications (like this WebApp)
- **Research Focus:** Making 200MB models run on 512MB devices

## Status
Probably debugging something right now. Or reading papers. Or building side projects because PhD research needs more caffeine and less bureaucracy.
